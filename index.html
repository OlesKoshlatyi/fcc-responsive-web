          Here are some basic projects I made during freeCodeCamp "Responsive

          <h2>css grid</h2>
          <p>
            In this project, I created a magazine article webpage using CSS Grid
            to design a responsive layout. The page features: Hero Section: A
            header with an image, title, subtitle, author information, and
            social media links. Article Content: Multiple sections with
            paragraphs, quotes, and a historical timeline of the curriculum.
            Media Integration: Embedded images and a video to enhance the visual
            appeal and context. This project showcases my ability to use CSS
            Grid for complex layouts, integrate multimedia elements, and create
            a visually engaging and structured article page.

          <h2>piano</h2>
          <p>
            In this project, I created a virtual piano using CSS and Responsive
            Design techniques to ensure it looks great on screens of all sizes.
            The webpage includes: FreeCodeCamp Logo: Displayed prominently at
            the top. Piano Keys: Implemented with div elements styled to
            resemble piano keys, including black keys for sharps. Responsive
            Design: Utilizes media queries to adjust the layout and styling
            based on different screen widths, ensuring a consistent user
            experience across devices. This project allowed me to apply CSS for
            layout and design, utilize media queries for responsiveness, and
            create an interactive element suitable for various screen sizes.

          <h2>product lending</h2>
          <p>
            In this project, I created a product landing page that demonstrates
            my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and responsive design. The page
            includes: Header: A header element with an embedded logo image and a
            navigation bar. Navigation Bar: A nav element with clickable links
            that navigate to corresponding sections of the page. Product Video:
            An embedded video showcasing the product. Contact Form: A form with
            an email input field that includes HTML5 validation and a submit
            button, which sends the email to a mock URL. Responsive Design: The
            navbar stays fixed at the top of the viewport, and the layout adapts
            using CSS flexbox and media queries. This project highlights my
            ability to build structured, user-friendly, and responsive web pages
            with interactive elements and effective navigation.

          <h2>survey form</h2>
          <p>
            For this project, I created a survey form that adheres to specific
            user stories, showcasing my skills in HTML and CSS. The form
            includes a title, a short description, and various input fields for
            name, email, and number with corresponding labels and placeholder
            text. Additionally, it features a dropdown menu, radio buttons,
            checkboxes, a textarea for comments, and a submit button. This
            project highlights my ability to build a functional, user-friendly
            form with proper validation and styling. Through this, I gained
            experience in organizing form elements, applying CSS for layout and
            design, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

            includes: A main content area with several sections, each with a
            unique ID and header. A fixed navigation bar on the left, containing
            links to each section for easy navigation. Various text, code, and

            responsive, and accessible web page. The page includes a main
            section containing a title, an image with a caption, descriptive
